Open the folder : 'large'.
Unzip all files into 'large' folder.

In MySQL Workbench open all the files in the 'scripts' folder.
Change the path to the .csv files where applicable in each script.

Note that the 'med' script took over 10 min to run, and at this time I have not run the large.

Your MySQL databases are now set up.
